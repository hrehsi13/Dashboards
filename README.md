## 📌 Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating across India, has been losing market share and revenue in the business/luxury hotel segment. In response, the company decided to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to support its revenue management strategy.

However, they lack an internal analytics team and hired a third-party data analyst (me) to help extract insights from historical data and build a revenue analysis dashboard to aid executive decision-making.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal was to design a Power BI dashboard that:

- Consolidates historical revenue data  
- Tracks key business performance metrics (KPIs)  
- Highlights underperforming regions or segments  
- Presents data in an interactive, decision-ready format
